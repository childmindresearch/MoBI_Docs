## The MoBI Mission
The Child Mind Institute’s Multimodal Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) Core accelerates the translation of data into knowledge. We develop processes and protocols across the Child Mind Institute’s research portfolio to standardize and scale reliable research methods. Our mission is to build multimodal lab spaces capable of simultaneously investigating brain activity; eye movements; physiological signals like heart rate, respiration rate, and skin conductance; speech and language patterns; graphomotor skills like handwriting and drawing; and body positioning and facial emotion recognition. We utilize a wide array of data collection equipment to ensure that our diverse research participants are equitably accommodated. The Core also develops extensible software pipelines to aid and automate data quality control and analysis, preprocessing, and feature extraction steps that are common within a data modality, regardless of area of scientific inquiry; the instant that data is collected in our lab spaces, it is translated to actionable insights.
