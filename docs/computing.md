    - Slowly lower and lock the CPU bracket locking arm.
3. Prepare the CPU cooler mount.
    - Open the CPU cooler box, and find all Intel-related components. Reference the instruction manual as needed.
    - Set up the backplate. Identify the side of the backplate that should face the motherboard. Insert four tall mounting bolts through the rear of the backplate, with bolt legs facing “upwards” through where the motherboard will be. Ensure that the triangular bolt heads are aligned with the outermost available positions on the backplate.
    - Affix the bolts using four clip-on plastic spacers.
    - Flip the motherboard over to its back.
    - Insert the assembled backplate bolts through the mounting holes on the motherboard.
    - Re-flip the motherboard to its front.
    - Place one blue plastic spacer on each of the four mounting bolts.
    - Place an arc-shaped mounting bar across the top two and bottom two mounting bolts, over the blue plastic spacers. The mounting bars should make a frowny face on top of the motherboard, and a smiley face right below. Affix the mounting bars with thumb screws, finger tighten.
4. Attach the RAM.
    - Remove the RAM from its packaging.
    - Refer to the motherboard manual to identify the suggested configurations for RAM placements.
    - Ensure that the RAM locking brackets on DIMMs A2 (2nd from left) and B2 (rightmost) are in the open position.
