We develop processes and protocols across the Child Mind Institute\u2019s research portfolio to standardize and scale reliable research methods. Our mission is to build multimodal lab spaces capable of simultaneously investigating brain activity; eye movements; physiological signals like heart rate, respiration rate, and skin conductance; speech and language patterns; graphomotor skills like handwriting and drawing; and body positioning and facial emotion recognition. We utilize a wide array of data collection equipment to ensure that our diverse research participants are equitably accommodated. The Core also develops extensible software pipelines to aid and automate data quality control and analysis, preprocessing, and feature extraction steps that are common within a data modality, regardless of area of scientific inquiry; the instant that data is collected in our lab spaces, it is translated to actionable insights.

Remove the adhesive backing from one of the included magnetic metal plates and affix it to the bottom of a display monitor \u2013 typically, the participant stimulus display monitor. Allow the adhesive to set for at least twelve hours before magnetically attaching the eye tracker to the magnetic metal plate. To perform test recording This eyetracker is plug and play. Once you have the EyeLogic Server set up (see Tabletop Eye Tracker Software Setup Guide ) you can plug this machine into the computer, calibrate, and you are ready to go! The instructions on how to perform a test recording can be found in the (see Tabletop Eye Tracker Software Setup Guide ), but to summarize below: Open the \u201ceyelogiclsl\u201d shortcut on the Desktop. Type the following at the command line: startstream Then type this: calibrate You will have the option to choose a number for calibration points (1,2,5,9). Select the number you would like. Once you pass calibration, you are ready to go! A note about the bounding box: The bounding box for the Eyelogic Lite is 50cm-85cm. For optimal data collection, please place the participant at around 60cm from the monitor. Please tell the participant to sit down and get comfortable and instruct the participant not to move. While the eye-tracker is more forgiving than brain imaging when it comes to the participant moving, it is still best if the participant stays as still as possible. Software Setup LabRecoder Setup: Please refer to LabRecorder Setup from the LSL and Computer Setup Guide. EyeLogic Server Setup: This is the required driver package to run EyeLogic devices. It is recommended to always update this software to the newest available version. Download Install EyeLogic Server according to the installer instructions Once the installation is complete, start the EyeLogic Server either by double clicking the shortcut on the Desktop or finding it from the Start menu. (Note: Nothing will pop-up, it will just silently run in the background). (Click on this icon to see the EyeLogic server panel) Toggle Tracking to on. This will show two white circles in the black screen next to the toggle if the eyes are found by the device. Calibration can also be done in the calibration tab; however, if you would like to use LSL then you need to do calibration when you start the LSL stream. EyeLogic LSL Plugin Setup: The EyeLogic integration into LSL includes a client which provides an LSL stream containing data from EyeLogic devices. Download . Once EyeLogic Server is up and running with the tracking option on, run the eyelogiclsl (Shortcut can be found on Desktop - with an MSN icon.) EyeLogic LSL console will popup. Type help for a list of available commands. (Note: if the second line does not read: LSL client connected, LSL Server may be off) To start the LSL stream, type startstream and type your sampling rate (60 / 120). Once the stream has initiated, it should also show up on the LabRecorder\u2019s list of Streams EyeLogic Lite Calibration: Calibration must be done for accurate eye tracking. Calibration function can be found both in the EyeLogic Server and in the EyeLogic LSL Plugin CLI. EyeLogic SDK Setup: The standard development kit is optional and only needed for users who want to access the EyeLogic device via the EyeLogic API. The SDK supports programming languages C++, C, Python, C# and Matlab. After downloading, unzip the file and read the contained pdf documentation to start using the SDK.

Testing Protocols Accelerometer ( ACC ) Work in progress... Electrocardiography ( ECG ) Preparation Set up the appropriate software tools to record and visualize the ECG signal. Ensure the ECG sensor is properly calibrated according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Instruct the subject to relax and remain still in the seated position throughout the testing procedure to minimize motion artifacts. Clean the skin area where the sensor will be attached using an alcohol swab to remove any oil or dirt. Properly place the ECG electrodes on the subject's body according to standard electrode placement guidelines (e. g ., Lead I configuration). Baseline Testing Record the signal for a fixed period (e. g ., 60 seconds). Review the recorded baseline ECG signals to ensure clarity, absence of noise, and proper detection of QRS complexes. Inspect the signal for any abnormalities (e. g ., high-frequency noise, baseline drift, artifacts). Dynamic Testing Conduct controlled exercise tests (e. g ., jumping jacks) to induce physiological changes in heart rate and rhythm. Monitor ECG signals during the testing period to assess the sensor's ability to accurately track dynamic changes in cardiac activity. Noise and Artifact Assessment Instruct the subject to perform controlled movements (e. g ., arm swings, deep breathing) or introduce other artifacts (e. g ., electrode movement, electrical interference) during ECG recording. Assess the impact of artifacts and noise on ECG signal quality and reliability. Documentation and Reporting Document the results of testing protocol, including baseline measurements, artifact assessment and dynamic testing. Summarize key findings regarding signal quality, consistency, and susceptibility to artifacts. Provide recommendations for optimizing ECG signal acquisition based on the observed strengths and weaknesses of the sensor. Suggest potential improvements or adjustments to electrode placement, signal processing techniques, or environmental conditions. Include any relevant data visualizations, graphs, or tables to support the findings and recommendations. Electrodermal Activity ( EDA ) Work in progress... Electromyography ( EMG ) Preparation Set up the appropriate software tools to record and visualize the EMG signal. Ensure the EMG sensor is properly calibrated according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Instruct the subject to relax and remain still in the seated position throughout the testing procedure to minimize motion artifacts. Clean the skin area where the sensor will be attached using an alcohol swab to remove any oil or dirt. Place the bipolar electrodes over the muscle group you want to test (e. g ., biceps). Place the reference electrode to the appropriate location. Refer to SENIAM recommendations for sensor location and placement . Baseline Testing Ask the subject to relax the muscle where the sensor is attached. Record the signal for a fixed period (e. g ., 60 seconds). The signal should be close to zero, indicating no muscle activity. Inspect the signal for any abnormalities (e. g ., high-frequency noise, baseline drift, artifacts). Muscle Activation Testing Instruct the subject to perform a series of controlled muscle contractions and relaxations. Ensure that the contractions are performed with consistent effort to avoid sudden changes in signal amplitude. Ensure that the EMG sensor captures the full range of muscle activation and accurately reflects the intensity of contraction. Take note of the muscle activity parameters, such as amplitude and duration of muscle contractions. Repeat the test to compare the characteristics of muscle activity across different recordings to assess signal consistency and reliability. Noise and Artifact Assessment Ask the subject to relax the muscle where the sensor is attached. Introduce controlled noise or artifacts during EMG signal acquisition (e. g ., electrode movement, electrical interference). Assess the impact of introduced artifacts on the EMG signal quality. Documentation and Reporting Document the results of testing protocol, including baseline measurements, muscle activation tasks and artifact assessment. Summarize key findings regarding signal quality, consistency, and susceptibility to artifacts. Provide recommendations for optimizing EMG signal acquisition based on the observed strengths and weaknesses of the sensor. Suggest potential improvements or adjustments to electrode placement, signal processing techniques, or environmental conditions. Include any relevant data visualizations, graphs, or tables to support the findings and recommendations. Inductive Respiration ( RIP ) Preparation Set up the appropriate software tools to record and visualize the RIP signal. Ensure the RIP sensor is properly calibrated according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Instruct the subject to relax and remain still in the seated position throughout the testing procedure to minimize motion artifacts. Properly place the strap on the subject's chest along the nipple line, as shown in the figure below: Chest Testing Record baseline respiratory signals using the RIP sensor for a sufficient duration (e. g ., 60 seconds) to establish stable baselines. Review the recorded baseline respiratory signals to ensure clarity, absence of noise, and consistent waveform morphology. Verify that the sensor accurately detects respiratory rate and patterns during rest. Instruct the subject to perform controlled breathing exercises (e. g ., slow deep breathing, rapid shallow breathing) at different respiratory rates and depths. Include respiratory pauses and apnea events followed by normal respiration. Assess the sensor\u2019s ability to capture and quantify changes in respiration dynamics. Abdominal Testing Change the position of the strap to the subject\u2019s upper abdomen, between 8th and 10th ribs, as shown in the figure above. Repeat the steps for chest testing, performing the same breathing exercises. Confirm that the signal recorded in the abdominal configuration presents a larger amplitude than the chest configuration. Dynamic Testing Instruct the subject to change body positions (e. g ., sitting, standing, lying down) and perform controlled movements (e. g ., arm swings, walking, jumping jacks) during RIP signal recording. Assess the sensor's ability to accurately capture respiratory signals under different postural and dynamic conditions. Noise and Artifact Assessment Introduce noise and artifacts (e. g ., strap movement, electrical interference) to simulate conditions that can affect the signal during the recording. Assess the impact of artifacts and noise on RIP signal quality and reliability. Documentation and Reporting Document the results of testing protocol, including baseline measurements, artifact assessment and dynamic testing. Summarize key findings regarding signal quality, consistency, and susceptibility to artifacts. Provide recommendations for optimizing RIP signal acquisition based on the observed strengths and weaknesses of the sensor. Suggest potential improvements or adjustments to electrode placement, signal processing techniques, or environmental conditions. Include any relevant data visualizations, graphs, or tables to support the findings and recommendations. Peripheral Capillary Oxygen Saturation ( SpO2 ) Work in progress...

Milham 1 2 1 Child Mind Institute, New York, USA 2 Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research, New York, USA Introduction With the continuous refinement of brain imaging methods such as MRI and EEG, researchers are gaining better insights into brain structure, function, and connectivity, enabling advances in understanding neurological and psychiatric disorders, as well as the neural basis of cognition, behavior, and emotion (Warbrick, 2022). A multimodal approach allows researchers to integrate complementary data types, addressing limitations of single-modality experiments and providing a broader perspective on brain function, connectivity, facial expressions, body language, and environmental context (Calhoun & Sui, 2016; Wagner et al., 2019). This approach is particularly valuable in social and cognitive sciences, offering deeper insights into communication, emotion regulation, and social interactions (Madsen & Parra, 2024). Here, we present a laboratory design for the next generation of data collection: a multimodal brain/body imaging approach (MoBI). A MoBI laboratory (Makeig et al., 2009) uses various techniques and data sources to examine brain activity in dynamic, interactive scenarios, along with other physiological and behavioral measures, including EEG, eye-tracking, motion capture, electromyography (EMG), electrocardiography (ECG), galvanic skin response, and audio/video recordings. Methods Multimodal data collection presents two primary challenges: Hardware and Software Requirements : Each modality's hardware and software requirements often rely on multiple computing systems and peripheral devices, creating logistical and operational burdens. Synchronization : The independent acquisition of data streams for each modality results in separate files, complicating synchronization of timestamps across devices. To overcome these challenges, we developed a centralized hub and data collection system for MoBI setups. This approach consolidates data streams from multiple modalities onto a single computer using the Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) framework (Kothe et al., 2024). By leveraging a shared system clock, we achieve precise synchronization and effective correction for time drift across devices, eliminating the need for additional synchronization hardware or extensive post hoc adjustments. An integrated architecture reduces latency and hardware complexity, ensures real-time monitoring, and maintains the temporal fidelity of multimodal datasets. To support this implementation, we developed comprehensive documentation that provides detailed guidance on every step of the process, from equipment evaluation through data collection. The documentation includes: Hardware specifications for building a MoBI system. Configuration details for the centralized computer. Best practices for data acquisition. This documentation aims to streamline the process for researchers and facilitate the adoption of robust and synchronized multimodal data collection workflows. Results We have successfully integrated a range of data acquisition systems into our MoBI framework, including (but not limited to): Dry and semi-dry EEG systems. Table-top and wearable eye-tracking devices. Physiological measurement modalities such as electrocardiography, electrodermal activity, inductive respiration, and peripheral oxygen saturation. Additionally, the setup supports: Multiple audio and video streams. Motion capture systems. Cognitive task presentations using PsychoPy and MindLogger (Klein et al., 2021). Figure 1 shows a schema of our setup. By centralizing computing resources to a single device, we exhibit a cost reduction of up to 50% compared to traditional laboratory designs. Conclusions Preliminary testing has demonstrated the LSL framework's robust capability to achieve clock synchronization and time drift correction across diverse devices, ensuring accurate temporal alignment of multimodal datasets. Our detailed documentation, publicly hosted at childmindresearch.github.io/MoBI_Docs , provides the research community with a valuable resource for replicating and adapting these methodologies for multimodal studies.
